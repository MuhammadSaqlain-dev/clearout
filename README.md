We are Team ClearOUT, and we're excited to introduce our AI chat assistant designed to help you dispose of and recycle items you no longer need.

Meet Our Team: Muhammad Saqlain, Luigi Palumbo, Pere Pasamonte, Rafiea Ashraf, Saksham Gupta, and Ubaid Ur Rehman. We met specifically for this hackathon, and all the work was completed in just a couple of days without any prior preparation.

# What is ClearOUT?
ClearOUT is a Recycling/Reuse AI Assistant. It helps people be more sustainable by reusing, donating, or recycling their items. Users can express interest in specific items or upload pictures of things they no longer want. The AI then matches these items with people who need them but cannot afford to buy them, or finds suitable recycling options. It can also function as a marketplace, allowing people to express their needs and find suitable items from a list of posted items.

# Technologies Used
